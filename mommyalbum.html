<div class= "lyrics"><p>You ain't gotta change <br>
You ain't gotta play the game <br>
Why you want to be like everybody else? <br>
Boy, get your belt <br>
Either that, or I'ma get it for you <br>
I better see some good grades or I'ma put it on you <br>
You insecure and it don't make sense <br>
You cute, smart, funny and skilled <br>
I know some people that would kill for your talent <br>
But you tripping over shit we can't afford <br>
This recession time <br>
Better count your blessings, slime <br>
You know how we living <br>
You be eating at your auntie's <br>
She got food up in her kitchen <br>
It won't be this way forever <br>
But right now that's how it is <br>
And if I could get you everything <br>
Shit, I probably would <br>
Then again I wouldn't <br>
'Cause it wouldn't do you good <br>
You better than a Yankee fitted <br>
You better than some Uptowns <br>
You better than your bad decisions <br> <br>
Sun gon' rise, sun gon' shine, sun gon' set <br>
Sun gon' rise, sun gon' shine, sun gon' set on you <br>
Sun gon' rise, sun gon' shine, sun gon' set <br>
Sun gon' rise, sun gon' shine, sun gon' set on you <br> <br>
You remind me of your dad <br>
'Cause you ain't shit <br>
Every day you in this class <br>
And your grades shit <br>
Dumb nigga, what the fuck is going on? <br>
Is you stupid, what is you doing? <br>
Why I let 'em hit it raw? <br>
I feel sorry for the both of us <br>
And I don't even mean to hurt your feelings <br>
I'm sorry, I'm just going through it <br>
Let's go and get those Jordans you wanted <br>
'Cause I can spend a few hundred <br>
My son the flyest nigga in the school <br>
Never see him in no off-brand <br>
You know I'ma put you in them Gucci's for the fall dance <br>
I been working late <br>
'Cause I gotta get this money <br>
Overtime so you won't be out here looking bummy <br>
I'll be damned <br>
We gon' be the freshest if I got to run a scam <br>
We don't even conversate with broke ones <br>
If the fit wack, then you show these niggas no love <br>
'Bout to hit the club for the night <br>
Here hold something <br> <br>
Sun gon' rise, sun gon' shine, sun gon' set <br>
Sun gon' rise, sun gon' shine, sun gon' set on you <br>
Sun gon' rise, sun gon' shine, sun gon' set <br>
Sun gon' rise, sun gon' shine, sun gon' set on you <br> <br>
I wish I had a mommy <br>
I wish I had some clean clothes <br>
I wish I had a family that gave a fuck <br>
I wish I had a bed <br>
I wish my shit was stable <br>
'Cause I'm trying to go to college <br>
And they pick you if your grades is up <br>
My surrogate a crack addict <br>
My sperm donor got out of prison, he back at it <br>
I'm A.D.D., malnutritioned and asthmatic <br>
I'm constantly the target of bullies that have status <br>
And it's overwhelming <br>
But I'm the first one at the school though <br>
And when I have kids they gon' always have the new clothes <br>
When I graduate <br>
I'm gon' get up out the hood <br>
Even though I hate my father, put a million on his books <br>
I don't give a fuck, everybody laughing at my clothes <br>
I don't give a fuck, niggas won't be laughing anymore <br>
When I'm rich as fuck <br>
And I'ma be there for my kids <br>
I'ma make sure they ain't never gotta live the way I've did, nah <br> <br>
Sun gon' rise, sun gon' shine, sun gon' set <br>
Sun gon' rise, sun gon' shine, sun gon' set on you <br>
Sun gon' rise, sun gon' shine, sun gon' set <br>
Sun gon' rise, sun gon' shine, sun gon' set on you</p> </div>
