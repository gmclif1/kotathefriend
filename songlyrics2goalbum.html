<div class="lyrics"><p>
I be sittin' in my crib doly <br>
She callin' me but that chick phony <br>
And when you got trust issues, it's gon' get lonely <br>
I don't be tourin' 'cause I'm makin' sure my kids know me <br>
Yeah, we just wanna smile <br>
Stay in good spirits even though we know this world is foul <br>
If you ever need me then I really hope you down <br>
If it's really gettin' to you say that shit out loud <br>
I remember when I learned that silence has a sound <br>
Yeah, life is simple <br>
Don't do nothin' stupid, get your money, count the zeros <br>
Marry someone beautiful and be somebody hero <br>
And do a lot of good until you turn into a mural <br>
Imagine I was stable <br>
But fuck it, I can't harp on what I ain't though <br>
Mental illness put food on my table <br> 
They don't give a fuck about you really, better stay woke <br>
It's almost time to run away and hide under the shade though, yeah</p> </div>
