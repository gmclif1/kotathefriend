<div class="lyrics"><p>Duh, duh, duh, duhhh, oh yeah <br>
Da-da, duh, duh, da-da <br>
Da-da-da-duh <br> <br>


Money power I'm watchin' 'em get devoured <br>
We dodgin' the devil's offers I'm wallowin' in the flowers <br>
It's sunny like every morning, good morning in California <br>
I'm staying in Pasadena away from all of the nausea <br>
Above it all, I'm askin' for nothin' more <br>
Than peace of mind, and in return I'll keep it 100 raw <br>
Out the sun roof, doin' 90 like fuck the law <br>
And all the hatred they be sending to me I brush it off <br>
I know it got you vexed 'cause you doubted me <br>
I know you got it out for me <br>
But know a lot of people in this motherfucker count on me <br>
To be the voice of reason and be the person I'm bout to be <br>
I should want revenge, but yo it's not what it's about for me <br>
Life above the politics flattered by every compliment <br>
Used to be suicidal I'm happy that I'm alive and shit <br>
JFK to LAX, call before I'm flyin' in <br>
Sailing on the ocean of possibility 'til I'm divin' in <br> <br>


Duh, duh, duh, duhhh, oh yeah <br>
Da-da, duh, duh, da-da <br>
Da-da-da-duh <br> <br>

[Asher Roth] <br>
Amazed how one day I feel great, the next hazy <br>
No wonder I feel crazy, wonder if they hear me prayin' <br>
Layin' ass for ambition, clarity understanding <br>
Feeling like I'm not a man, they say when you lose a pair <br>
And apparently I ain't there yet, living a life inherited <br>
Glaring with many errors, farewell as far as fair is <br>
But the fairest in the land, a question I ain't caring <br>
Embarrassment to them, maybe it's all a plan
I feel I should just split to position of more patience <br>
Reason for the frustration, travel to many places <br>
On the way to Pasadena just to see the scenery <br>
Hope to see the same in me, but where you go there you be <br>
Stay or leave, A or B, I believe it's meant to be <br>
Take a break to shake the bees, hope the vision will increase <br>
It ain't easy being being, seems to be one of defeat <br>
Hope to see you when I reach where those two sides meet
Until then <br> <br>

[Asher Roth] <br>
Da-da-da-duh <br>
Duh, duh, duh, duhhh, oh yeah <br>
Oh yeah
