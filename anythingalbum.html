<div class="lyrics"> <p> Mama said eat your veggies <br>
Mama said opinions won't pay your rent <br>
Mama said money won't make you rich <br>
Mama said boy you better wash your dish <br>
Fuck raw then raise your kids <br>
Don't do it if it make no sense <br>
If they dip when you down then they ain't your friends <br>
Stay you, don't obey no trends <br> <br>
Too much in my head <br>
I ain't got no time <br>
Gotta get this bread <br>
Gotta get this wine <br>
Don't bring up no drama when you hit me on my line <br>
If it ain't the commas on my mama it's declined <br> <br>
I don't drink no coca-cola <br>
Soul is so like Motorola's <br>
Only want it if its Kosher <br>
Not a hole, i'd rather nola <br>
Darling, you know i am boring <br>
I don't like the club but you can stay and grab a cup <br>
I'm just a nigga from New York <br>
Yankee, fitted in my trunk <br>
Took a minute now but i'm lit and now my city show me love <br>
Brooklyn spread the love <br>
Get your funds <br>
Used to take the g and now we count em up <br>
Broke a lot of hearts and all that i can say was i was young <br>
Call me on my jack <br>
All my nigga's really got my back <br>
Shorty got my heart <br>
So i promise her that i'll be back <br>
If it feel like love, lil homie then it's probably that <br>
If you got a feeling she a thottie, she probably that <br> <br>
Too much in my head <br>
I ain't got no time <br>
Gotta get this bread <br>
Gotta get this wine <br>
Don't bring up no drama when you hit me on my line <br>
If it ain't the commas on my mama it's declined <br> <br>
Fuck up some commas <br>
I'm just trying to make some racks i can spend on my mama <br>
Small city had me feeling like i'm Napoleon <br>
But i ain't talking to no Tina's and feeding no llama's <br>
And girls with sharks and piranha's <br>
Hype beast's and all pre Madonna's <br>
Came a long way from a kid <br>
Now i'm a man trying to stay who he is <br>
But he say he's different, i'm not who i was <br>
I can only affect how i exist in the present <br>
The noblest king was a peasant <br>
An hour can change in a second <br>
The entrance is often the exit <br>
I get in the plane, i need presents <br>
So keep your bullshit, i'm a presence aye <br>
Part of me is i'm partin' seas <br>
Not a ten man, all this heart in me is <br>
I ran to the meter <br>
Pay the parking fees <br>
When you're for the fence <br>
Chef and recipees <br>
Till i rest in peace <br>
Blood and elbow grease <br>
Going hard to my final now <br>
Y'all be draining the spinal tap <br>
I'm still chewing on bottle caps <br>
And i say <br>
Fuck they rules and just do it your own way
