<div class= "lyrics"><p>New day, new crib, new kicks too 
    <br> 
You brag, okay, we lit too <br>
New way, new mind, new wave <br>
Oh wine glass up for the drama that we live through, ay <br>
Get it Kota, yuh, hit the woah, uh, yeah <br>
I be off beat, ay, they like so what? <br>
I could spend a whole week on my sofa <br>
Shoutout to the chip on my shoulder <br>
I don't dance, I just kick it on the side, yeah <br>
Fuck a new year, every year is my year <br>
New York, where I'm from, I'ma die here <br>
Don't like me, ah man, see if I care, ay <br>
Old soul don't fold, roll solo <br>
Old head, I might pull up in the Volvo <br>
Go hard, I ain't tryna live so-so <br> <br>
Do my thing, uh <br>
I am free, uh <br>
With the steez, uh <br>
Get my piece, uh <br>
Get my bread right <br>
Get my head right <br>
No regrets, never stress <br>
Wit an end like <br>
Put my chair where the grass is cut, yeah <br>
That's my queen and she bad as fuck, yeah <br>
Bad vibes just so yesterday, yeah <br>
Hope you niggas get up out the bed today, ay <br> <br>
New year, same me, no bullshit, yeah <br>
Real life got hard for the cool kids, ay <br>
All real no fake, no new news <br>
No subways, no choo choos, nah nah <br>
Sad boy, sit up in the crib for the whole day <br>
My girl ain't up in the mix, she a no name <br>
Winter time, playing Cold Train on a snow day <br>
Stayin' warm with an old flame so it's okay, yeah <br>
Good day, good son, good head too <br>
Good champagne, sip it in the bedroom <br>
Bike ride by the river, gotta get loose <br>
Big smile on my face, I'm a blessed fool <br>
I was gone, but I'm home now, yeah <br>
I was young but I'm grown now, yeah <br>
This is what a nigga chose <br>
With the cons and the pros <br>
Gotta let it all go (gotta let it all go) <br> <br>
Do my thing, uh <br>
I am free, uh <br>
With the steez, uh <br>
Get my piece, uh <br>
Get my bread right <br>
Get my head right <br>
No regrets, never stress <br>
Wit an end like <br>
Put my chair where the grass is cut, yeah <br>
That's my queen and she bad as fuck, yeah <br>
Bad vibes just so yesterday, yeah <br>
Hope you niggas get up out the bed today, ay <br> <br>
Put my chair where the grass is cut, yeah <br>
That's my queen and she bad as fuck, yeah <br>
Bad vibes just so yesterday, yeah <br>
Hope you niggas get up out the bed today, ay</p>
