<div class="lyrics"> <p> Why you gotta be so mean? <br>
I be the only one on your team <br>
That nigga only wanna fuck you twice <br>
Fuck it I ain't really tryna cause no scene <br>
I've been trying to make you my girl <br>
You ain't tryna give me that shot it seem <br>
You be in my DMs when you bored <br>
You just really wanna keep me on your string <br>
Girl you wrong, know you are <br>
You just mad cause I told you off <br>
Know what, you ain't gotta tell me shit <br>
But under that shell, girl I know you soft <br>
Right now you just playing but by the time that you ready <br>
I trust it'll be too late, there's nothing that you can say <br>
I'm a thousand miles away on an island where there's no Twitter <br>
And iMessage is delayed <br> like 'bout forever in a day <br>
I lay low, on my grind <br>
If not you'll take all my time <br>
Just cause you been on my mind <br>
To my room I be confined <br>
I'm just chatting, truth is you ain't all that kid <br>
You was just cute with an eye for the fashion <br>
Could've been a thing girl, shit so tragic <br>
By my side while I zip through traffic <br>
Ooh, hope you good <br>
Living your life like I know you would <br>
Showing off with that smile I love <br>
Getting your dreams like I know you could <br> <br>


I call, she call <br>
I miss, she miss <br>
I fall, she stand <br>
She fall, I dip <br>
She lie, I lie <br>
It's never ending <br>
She lose, I lose <br>
Nobody winning <br> <br>
 

Just don't got the time,  <br> gotta get paid it's the bottom line <br>
And you love me girl, and I know you do <br>
Just don't got that much love for you <br>
And I try to leave, but you make it hard <br>
And you hate when a brother gotta tell the truth <br>
You drag it out, and I hold you close <br>
And in the end I ain't even really helping you <br>
See I got a thing for this new chick <br>
She bad news but we similar <br>
'Cause she fucked up and she stupid <br>
And she don't even know what's good for her <br>
And I drown the pain in this vodka, <br> head on spin like a chopper <br>
Heart torn up into pieces,  <br> tired as fuck of the drama <br>
Mama said, you too young to fall in love,<br> you just 16
But I ain't listen,<br> now I'm in this shit, time is passing I'm 23 <br>
I don't trust a soul, like what the fuck? <br>
Maybe it's best that I be alone <br>
Either she creeping or she get too high <br> or she stay meddling through my phone <br>
But this our generation, stressed and anxious <br>
Folks so fucking basic, <br> we so angry and we so sad <br>
When we get a good thing we don't know how to take it <br>
Everything be so simple, <br> but we make it so complex <br>
And one day she'll uplift you, <br> next day you left on read
You know <br> <br>


I call, she call <br>
I miss, she miss <br>
I fall, she stand <br>
She fall, I dip <br>
She lie, I lie <br>
It's never ending <br>
She lose, I lose <br>
Nobody winning <br> <br>


And I tried, but this shit just way too hard <br>
Girl our love shouldn't be no job <br>
Gotta thank god for the bullets I dodge <br>
I pray hard for the woman that love me <br>
If she find me that's her loss <br>
Gonna be dolo all my days, <br> uh, watch me live mad long, I'm exhausted <br>
Now I'm free like every morning <br>
Sun is shining, birds is flying, <br> Life is good in California <br>
Me and Jack, that's my rider, <br> Jet Blue say we be frequent flyers <br>
Basic bitches stay away <br> Cause they don't see me in designers <br>
Oh, that's fine with me, I be on my odyssey <br>
I live life for me and my fam got a lot to see <br>
There ain't nothing that I'm tryna be <br>
Yo I'm classic, in the crib with the iTunes blasting <br>
Incense lit by the key lime cactus <br>
Floors stay swept and the fridge stay packed <br>
Kid cooking up some smoked Salmon <br>
I'ma still think about you, <br> And I'ma still ink about you <br>
And I'ma say only good things <br> To my friends when I speak about you <br>
Cause I ain't gotta reason not to <br>
You're a joy, you're a queen <br>
Could have been something that I need <br>
If I wasn't me and you wasn't hurt <br>
If we wasn't broken, then we could work <br> <br>


I call, she call <br>
I miss, she miss <br>
I fall, she stand <br>
She fall, I dip <br>
She lie, I lie <br>
It's never ending <br>
She lose, I lose <br>
Nobody winning
